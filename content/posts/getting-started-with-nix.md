> Nix, the purely functional package manager.

The Nix package manager has been, on and off, on my radar for a couple of years now, the premise of it, using "functional programing"-esque behaviours in order to create a reproducible package manager, seemed very intriguing! I mean you know, _it has to be cool because it has **purely functional** in its tagline_! This post is a beginning of a group of posts as I experiment and play around with Nix, partially inspired by this ongoing [playlist from Shopify's Burke Libbey](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRGI9KQ3_HP_OFRG6R-p4iFgMSK1t5BHs), who's videos reignited my interest in Nix!
