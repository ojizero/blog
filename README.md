You can visit the [first post](https://blog.ojizero.tech/posts/100daystooffload/) for the first post and a quick reasoning as to why this exists!

In short, I want to document my experiences (mainly in tech stuff), as well as to hone my writing skills somewhat. The blog itself is one of the experiences/expirments I'm doing, hopefully I stick with it.

You can browse it over here https://blog.ojizero.tech, I also will post some of its content over on HackerNews and Medium.
