At least to try something new, if not to make it a permanent new norm!</p><p>A direct goal is to improve my ability to express myself, especially in written form, and indirectly to force myself into more experimentation as ways to generate things to write about!</p><h2 id=the-what>The What</h2><p>This is just an intro of sorts, most prominently I imagine posts to be more focused on tech related things, maybe new technologies I find interesting, or things I wanna try out. Or existing technologies I decide to deep-dive into.</p><p>And maybe the occasional non-technical post, who knows! The import part is to start, we’ll figure things out as we go!</p><h2 id=perfect-an-enemy-of-done>Perfect, an enemy of done?</h2><p>There are many enemies for finishing a thing, perhaps the strongest of those enemies if perfection! Nothing is prefect, and striving for it will only bring delays, maybes, and nothing could be done.</p><p>So let&rsquo;s start now, no need for things to be perfect, no need for things be flawless, but they need to be &ldquo;done&rdquo;, in order to improve such that the next time you start, you&rsquo;ll be a touch closer to that impossible perfection. So here we go with the bad writing :D</p><h2 id=100daystooffload>#100DaysToOffload</h2><blockquote><p>Let the experiment begin!</p></blockquote></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><a href=https://blog.ojizero.tech class=logo style=text-decoration:none><span class=logo__mark><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="greater-icon" viewBox="0 0 44 44"><path fill="none" d="M15 8l14.729 14.382L15 35.367"/></svg></span><span class=logo__text>ojizero/blog</span>
